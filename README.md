## Hi! This is a test task for CFLOX

To launch this project please:
1) run `npm ci`
2) run `npm run dev`

If you want to check how tests are doing, please, run `npm run tests`

Design [reference](https://dribbble.com/shots/19973856-Unit-Converter-Figma-Plugin#)

Project running with React. No state management - we don't need it here. For 
tests, I used [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [TL](https://testing-library.com/). 
Everything styled with plan CSS, but it doesn't mean that I have issues
with CSS-in-JS, preprocessors or any other tool.
